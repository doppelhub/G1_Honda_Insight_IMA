D2, D3, D4 use incorrect footprint:
1: cathode
2: anode
3: NC

BAT54-FDITR-ND correct footprint:
1: cathode
2: NC
3: anode

BAT54S is the only diode found that has a connection between pins 1&2, but the diode faces the wrong direction (i.e. 12V would always flow through it).  

Suggested corrective action:
If PCB requires a spin, fix diode in schematic by adding a three terminal version using correct footprint.
Do not place components on RevA PCB.  Determine if high side line drivers can handle backemf generated by opening relay coils.  D2/D3/D4 were only added as supplemental overvoltage protection; it's possible they aren't needed.  Use a scope to monitor flyback voltage when relay is opened. 

Workaround:
If High side relay drivers can't handle backemf when relays opened, hand solder D2/D3/D4 by rotating slightly.
