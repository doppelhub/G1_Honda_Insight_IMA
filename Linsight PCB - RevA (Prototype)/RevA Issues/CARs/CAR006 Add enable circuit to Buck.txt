Buck squeals when 12V rail drops below 7V.  To fix, add voltage divider to 'RUN' pin.  Rtop=20k, Rbottom=3.3k.  The LTC3646 has a guaranteed 1.17:1.26 enable voltage, so the resistor divider guarantees Linsight is disabled below 8.26Vin, and guarantees that Linsight is enabled above 8.90Vin.  This will allow the user to disconnect the 12V battery to completely disable Linsight, unless either the grid charger is plugged in and charging AND/OR the fans are enabled... in both cases, Linsight will enable the DCDC converter.
