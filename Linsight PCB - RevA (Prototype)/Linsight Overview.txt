What is Linsight?
Linsight is a plug-and-play lithium battery upgrade designed specifically for the G1 Honda Insight.  Goal: cheaper than NiMH

Linsight replaces the following OEM components (everything in the box):
-NiMH battery -> BYOLi (bring your own lithium)(36S onboard, )
-MCM (motor control module) -> Linsight PCB
-BCM (battery control module) -> (same) Linsight PCB
(Picture: Left: OEM, Right: Linsight)

(Show PCB, highlighting plug-and-play connectors & screw terminals)
-No harness cuts*
*DCDC control when key 'off' requires two simple cuts 

Installing Linsight
-Buy batteries.  Modify Leaf cells (if using Leaf cells).
-Install batteries (might require converter/inverter removal)
-If using more than 36S, purchase LTC demo boards (12S/board)
-Remove OEM battery and computers
-disassemble battery board (show picture with required components)
-install 

Linsight replicates the following aftermarket components:
-manual IMA control systems (MIMA, etc)
-current hack boards (technically can still use, but no need; complete SW control)
-BCM battery spoof boards (nothing to reuse, BCM no longer present)
-grid chargers (you can reuse certain grid chargers)
-joysticks (Peter's joysticks that plug into OBDIIC&C compatible)

Linsight is compatible with anything external to the OEM MCM/BCM
-Internal MCM modifications not compatible

Timeline: Linsight is a pet project.  I work on it as time allows.  If there's enough interest to make financial sense, I can prioritize it above other consulting work.  Most of my potential buyers are probably in this room.  Certainly the early adopters are sitting right here.  

Using more than 36S cells (can I make 48S fit?)

Bonus Slide for non-Linsight cars: Enable DCDC while grid charging (with key on)
Enable DCDC whenever key is on:
cut WHT/GRN (ECU) - DCDC pin A9
cut GRN/BLK (MCM) - DCDC pin 

You could install a DPST relay to force DCDC on whenever key on (e.g. while charging)

...

DCDC outputs 14V@20A with input down to 62 V.  Between 58-62V the output is no longer in regulation (it falls proportional to input voltage).
