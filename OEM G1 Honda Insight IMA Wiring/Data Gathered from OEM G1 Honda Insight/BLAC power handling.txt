The motor is 3 Phase Permanent Magnet Brushless DC rated by Honda at 10kw.
We have no idea if that is a 1 hour rating, I doubt it. Probably more like <5 minutes.
You can overdrive it at 15kw for short periods < 30 seconds. +50%
It will tolerate 3-5kw for longer periods. It looks like 7kW continuous for an hour is safe.

Closed system (i.e. worst case) thermal mass calculations on page 58 of MIT paper.  In summary:
-figure out how much thermal mass the IMA motor has to sink heat into... ~=30 kg (guess)
-multiply thermal mass times energy absorption constant (~384 J/(kg-Kelvin) for copper & 460 J/(kg-Kelvin) for steel)
(http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-metals-d_152.html)
-figure out maximum temperature tolerated by IMA motor (in degC).
-figure out DC resistance in one phase (note in delta there's some simple math required)

time_to_increase_temp_n_degC = thermal_mass * material_energy_absorption_constant * degC_allowed to increase / ( 3 * I_rms^2 * R_phase)

For example, you can run the BLDC motor at 80 A for 104 seconds with the following assumptions:
-20 kg thermal mass
-400 J/(kg-Kelvin) material energy absorption constant
-50 degC temperature rise
-80 A rms
-200 mOhm phase resistance

For example, you can run the BLDC motor at 15 A for 49 minutes with zero external cooling, and only 50 degC temperature rise.
