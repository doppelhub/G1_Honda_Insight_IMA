MAMODE1 (why three instances? (probably wrong)= PWM

Mode:
-PRESTART= CmdPwr ?       MaMode1 15%*  MaMode2 ?
-Standby = CmdPwr 50:30%  MaMode1 50%   MaMode2 High
-Assist  = CmdPwr 51:90%  Mamode1 25%   MaMode2 Low
-Regen   = CmdPwr 49:10%  MaMode1 35%   MaMode2 High
-Start   = CmdPwr 50%     MaMode1 85%   MaMode2 Low
(Unverified) clarification:
-Standby (idle charge) = CmdPwr 50:30%  MaMode1 45%   MaMode2 High
-Standby (stop charge) = CmdPwr 50%     MaMode1 55%   MaMode2 High
-Standby (smooth idle) = CmdPwr ?	MaMode1 60%   MaMode2 ?
-AutoStop	       = CmdPwr ?	MaMode1 70    MaMode2 ?

*15% on MAMODE1 shuts DC-DC off. Any other duty enables it.
Pulling MAMODE2 low turns DC-DC turns on regardless of duty on MAMODE1.

Inside MCM, opamp integrates PSM, then adc converts to an 8-bit 0-5V.  Conclusion: PWM frequency doesn't matter.
